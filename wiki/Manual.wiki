LetÂ´s go step by step.

*_SVN checkout_*
  * Perform a checkout from the SVN in Downloads tab, in order to install the app. 

*_Installation_*
  * No prerequisites needed. [https://code.google.com/p/karmind-obd-application/wiki/Installation Further information about setup].

*_Execute application_*
  * Assuming you have followed the instructions above, the karmind app is already installed in your computer, on the location you selected during the installation process. Thus, you may launch the app from your start menu, browsing to the karmind app and clicking on the executable.
  * At this point, Karmind app window raises, with three available options to perform. Before executing any task, following requirements are needed:
  # The ELM327 unit you will use with Karmind software altogheter, must have been installed and tested previously in the same computer as Karmind app.
  # The ELM 327 hardware has to be connected in both sides, the vehicle and the computer.
  # For some car brands, the car engine must be started.

  Not following earlier requirements will lead to Karmind app malfunction and even crash.

*_App modes_*
  * Being built.

Be aware of the fact that this app was made with extremely limited resources, and therefore could only be checked against a few brand cars. Thus, it is quite likely to fail while testing against some kind of vehicles. 

Any doubt, improvement or bug to report, let us know, please, hereby or at www.karmind.com. We will be pleased of hearing from you.
